        <Content>
          <p>Graduated Communication & Multimedia Design at The University of Amsterdam with a 9. Iâ€™ve got the oppertunity to work on a project at Label A and created a transport sharing platform for companies in big cities using React Native. With this project I was nominated for a Golden Dot Award (Best Student Work of the University). See my project for Huub - Next Urban Mobility.</p>
          <p>In June a signed a contract to start as a front-end developer at Label A. At Label A we create web- and mobile applications using the latest technologies. Within the front-end department we use React. In November I gave a talk on a meetup about performance in bigger front-end apps. You can read "How we optimized grocerie shopping" on my blog.</p>
